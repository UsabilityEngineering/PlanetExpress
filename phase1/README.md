# Planet Express, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods
  The method that we used for our requirements gathering was an interview. We asked the users about their experiences with trying to find specific rooms in an apartment complex type setting and how they would make that experience better. We felt that this would give us some good insight into the problem space and what features our app should have. We only ended up with four subjects for our interviews, but they did provide some good data and suggestions for us.


## Findings
  For our findings we collected data from a few participants. All participants are college students. From our data we found that on third of the interviewees make deliveries often. This means that half the interviewees represent our user base. From our data we can also conclude that a majority of our participants are currently satisfied with their GPS app of choice, although one did show slight dissatisfaction with the GPS on their car. We also discovered that some of our participants like being able to see their map displayed on the lock screen. Based on our findings, the top three apps our participants use are Waze, Apple, and google maps. We also found that users can feel frustrated when they canâ€™t find a room number at a location and they are often hesitant to call someone for assistance. 


## Conclusions
  One requirement of our app is to make sure you can see the map on lock screen because during our interviews we found that feature popular amongst users. Another feature that our app will have is that the location service will only be on when the app is in use because during the interviews there was a participant who showed strong concerns about privacy and battery life. The user interface will have to be simple and effective as that were some of the things that came up most during the interviews.


## Caveats
 The main caveat we have is definitely the lack of people available. While we did get some valuable data from our three interviewees, that is definitely not enough people to really get solid data for your project.
