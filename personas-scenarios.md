# Scenarios

## (A) Delivery time

The first scenario is a doordash driver who has to deliver to a specific apartment. They have likely never been to that complex before and as a result will probably have some difficulty getting around. With our app, they will be able to get precise directions that take them straight to the door of the apartment so they can quickly deliver the food and get back on the road to pickup a new order instead of wandering around for 10 minutes trying to find a map/help desk so they can locate the specific room.


## (B) Find a friend

The second scenario is someone trying to find their friend’s place that they’ve never been to before. The friend gave basic directions but they are hard to follow and it’s still easy to get lost. With our app, it will give you clear and easy directions to get to the desired room so you don’t have to call your friend and have a 10 minute conversation of you trying to describe which of the seven identical white buildings you are next to.

## (C) Being a Chad

After many failures on Tinder, Chad finally found a girl willing to netflix and chill with him! The only problem is that Chad lives in a different building in the opposite side of campus. After taking a few swigs of grandpa's ol' cough medicine, Chad slips into his tank top and heads out.
