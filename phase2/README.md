## Phase 2: Interaction Design

### Executive Summary

  For this deliverable we completed our wireframe and flushed out some of the detailed features for our app. Our wireframe shows you the main page and main menu, as well as both our standard navigation and AR navigation with all of their respective pop out menus. It also works as a prototype draft with functional buttons to allow you to navigate around to all the different pages of the app.
