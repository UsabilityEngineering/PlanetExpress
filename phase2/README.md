## Phase 2: Interaction Design

### Executive Summary

  For this deliverable we completed our wireframe and flushed out some of the detailed features for our app. Our wireframe shows you the main page and main menu, as well as both our standard navigation and AR navigation with all of their respective pop out menus. It also works as a prototype draft with functional buttons to allow you to navigate around to all the different pages of the app.

### Wireframe Images
#### Main Page
This is our main page that has a search bar at the top, a pull up menu at the bottom, and a traditional, top-down GPS map. This main page is fairly similar to Google Maps since a majority of our interviewees mentioned that they're satisfied with their current GPS application, and we didn't want to reinvent the wheel too much if we didn't need to.

#### Search Bar
This is the search bar where you can enter in the start and end locations of your desired route. Like the main page, this is pretty standard for any GPS application.

#### Speech To Text
This is the pop-up that appears when you use speech-to-text to enter in an address.

#### Main Menu Pulled Up
This is our main menu that can be pulled up from the bottom of the main page. This provides you with an interface for your favorite locations and recent destinations, as well as the ability to switch to the AR navigation.

#### AR Navigation Warning
This warning pops up when you first turn on AR navigation. It warns you to be careful when using AR as well as mentioning that AR navigation is automatically turned off when you are traveling too fast since it is a safety hazard when driving and is meant for navigating while walking only.

#### AR Navigation
This is the AR navigation page that shows the world around you and superimposes an arrow onto the ground that directs you to where you are trying to go, including a specific room #.

#### AR Navigation w/ Bubble Menu Open
This page is the AR navigation page from above, but with the bubble menu in the top left opened instead of closed. This menu provides a more heads up alternative to the pull-up menu from the main page that isn't as intrusive and allows you to still see your navigation.

#### AR Navigation w/ Aerial View Open
This page is the AR navigation page from above, but with the aerial "minimap" tab opened. This tab is an option so that people can still see the traditional top-down view while in AR mode, but also have the option to close it so it's not obstructing your view.

#### AR Navigation w/ Both Menus Open
This page is the AR navigation page from above, but with both of the pop-outs opened.

#### Traditional Navigation
This page is the more traditional navigation page with a top down view and streets highlighted to show you where to go.

#### Traditional Navigation w/ AR View Open
This page is the traditional navigation page from above, but with the AR viewer opened. Much like the aerial view tab, this tab allows you to still see the AR navigation in a small pop-out window in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
