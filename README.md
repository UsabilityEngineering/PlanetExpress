# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

* Explored how often people ran into issues finding a specific apartment/room in a complex
  * How did they go about finding it
  * What obstacles did they have to overcome
  * How did they feel about the situation
* All **(100%)** of the interviewees had been in a situation where they could not find a room at a location
* **Interviews** recorded users (n = 4) experiences with finding a room in a large complex
* Majority of interviewees reported **favorable opinions** of their current GPS apps
* Some participants make deliveries often (25%)
  * Interviewees who make frequent deliveries reported that they often have difficulty locating a specific room 
  * **Ordered room numbers** seem pretty essential to having success finding a room without our app
* Some users (25%) didn’t like having to use **outside assistance** to help them find a room.
* All **(100%)** interviewees reported some sort of **negative emotions**, even after successfully finding their room
* **Designed personas and scenarios** to represent the main users of our app:
  * Doug - Delivery Driver who frequently has to find rooms in unfamiliar complexes for deliveries
  * Sarah - Everyday person who occasionally will need help finding a room in a large complex

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

* Our **wireframe** started with a base very similar to Google maps since most of our interviewees reported **favorable opinions** of their current GPS apps.
  * Didn't want to reinvent the wheel if it works.
* While it can't really be displayed in the wireframe, our app will have the ability to take you to specific room numbers, not just to a larger complex.
  * We had found that people often had difficulty finding specific rooms if the room numbers were not numbered.
* We also decided to add an augmented reality style navigation in addition to having a regular navigation option.
  * This wasn't mentioned in our **requirements gathering**, but we think this would be a good feature to have for when you get out of your car and are navigating through a large complex.
  * Have the ability to still use traditional maps if you want to or if you are driving in which case the AR functionality is turned off.

# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

-Our approach is more formative than summative but has little bits of both
	-Multiple questions involve observing them as they attempt to use the app
	-A few questions ask for their feedback of various features after they’ve used the app
-We provide a variety of scenarios for the user to work through
	-Test different features of the app
	-Provides more trials to potentially find bugs/other issues
-We will generally encourage the user to think out loud while testing the app to provide us with additional data, particularly about the **usability** of the app 
-We want to leave room for the user to provide any additional feedback that they think of, even if we don’t explicitly ask about it
	-Ask general “What are your thoughts about…” questions
	-Have an additional feedback section at the end
