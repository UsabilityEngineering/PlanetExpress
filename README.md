# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

* Explored how often people ran into issues finding a specific apartment/room in a complex
  * How did they go about finding it
  * What obstacles did they have to overcome
  * How did they feel about the situation
* All **(100%)** of the interviewees had been in a situation where they could not find a room at a location
* **Interviews** recorded users (n = 4) experiences with finding a room in a large complex
* Majority of interviewees reported **favorable opinions** of their current GPS apps
* Some participants make deliveries often (25%)
  * Interviewees who make frequent deliveries reported that they often have difficulty locating a specific room 
  * **Ordered room numbers** seem pretty essential to having success finding a room without our app
* Some users (25%) didnâ€™t like having to use **outside assistance** to help them find a room.
* All **(100%)** interviewees reported some sort of **negative emotions**, even after successfully finding their room
* **Designed personas and scenarios** to represent the main users of our app:
  * Doug - Delivery Driver who frequently has to find rooms in unfamiliar complexes for deliveries
  * Sarah - Everyday person who occasionally will need help finding a room in a large complex
