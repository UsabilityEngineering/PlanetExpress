## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

[**Protocol**](protocol-draft.pdf)

[**Data Collection Spreadsheet**]()

**Background:**
*Think back to when you had to find a room/unit at some location. How did you find it?*

This task should give us some basic insight into the most commonly used tools for finding a room/unit in an unfamiliar building. This will help see how our app compares to other forms of navigation by seeing how different people with different backgrounds (using a map/traditional gps/etc…) react differently to our app.


**Tasks:**
*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “very difficult” and 5 is “very easy” how would you rate being able to use this app design to accomplish this task? Why?*

*1. Find a friends apartment for the first time*
	
One of the most common use cases for our app is finding a friend’s apartment/hotel room for the first time. This question will give us feedback on how **effective** our app is at accomplishing that goal.

*2. Find a given room in your current building*

Since the first question is more of a hypothetical, we also want to observe the users actually attempting to use our app in real time. This should provide additional information on specific obstacles or bugs that we wouldn’t necessarily think about when examining the app itself.

*3. Find a different room in this building using the ar navigation*

This question, like the previous one is intended to provide us with real time observations of the user testing the app. This question, however, is focused on the AR features which should pose some different obstacles.

**Wrap-up:**
*1. What did you like the most?*
	
This question should provide us with some feedback on the most successful parts of our app, so that we know what works well.
	
*2. What did you dislike the most?*
	
This question should provide us with some feedback on the least successful parts of our app, so that we know what we need to improve.

*3. What other features would you recommend/want?*
	
This question, along with the previous question, allows us to get idea from the users on potential features that the end user might want us to implement.

*4. Thoughts on AR*

This question should give us some more detailed feedback on the augmented reality feature including what worked and what didn’t.

*5. Thoughts on Traditional Map*

This question should give us some more detailed feedback on the base functionality of the app and what the users thought about it.

*6. Other comments/feedback*

This question allows the user to provide any additional feedback that they deem to be relevant, so it acts as a catch all for anything that we may have forgotten to ask about.
